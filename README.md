## Standard Corsi Test – Java Swing GUI Application Implementation

The Standard Corsi Test is a psychological test that tests short-term memory of people who play it. The game arranges 9 blocks in random locations on a screen. 
A pattern of blocks is then lit up, in a specific random order. The participant is then asked to repeat this pattern in either the same or reverse order. 
This project explores an implementation of this test us-ing the Java’s Swing GUI component system. This pproject take a unique approach of investigating the correlations 
of a participant’s usage of the software and their Corsi score.
